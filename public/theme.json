Starting the non-profit 'Food-On-Every-Table' we sought financial support from companies to address the urgent issue of hunger. However, the response was dishearteningly silent, prompting us to reassess our approach. \n\n Recognizing the economic challenges faced by businesses, coupled with South Africa's staggering 40% unemployment rate, we understood the need for a sustainable solution that addressed both hunger and unemployment.

Out of this realization, INA ETHE emerged â€“ a dynamic solution uniting non-profits and individuals, fostering a community where support and financial sustainability converge to create meaningful change.
