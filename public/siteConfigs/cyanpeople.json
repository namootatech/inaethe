However, the response was dishearteningly silent, prompting us to reassess our approach. \n\n Recognizing the economic challenges faced by businesses, coupled with South Africa's staggering 40% unemployment rate, we understood the need for a sustainable solution that addressed both hunger and unemployment.

Out of this realization, CYan People emerged â€“ a dynamic solution uniting non-profits and individuals, fostering a community where support and financial sustainability converge to create meaningful change.
