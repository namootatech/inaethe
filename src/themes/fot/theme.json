Starting the non-profit 'Food-On-Every-Table' we sought financial support from companies to address the urgent issue of hunger. However, the response was dishearteningly silent, prompting us to reassess our approach. \n\n Recognizing the economic challenges faced by businesses, coupled with South Africa's staggering 40% unemployment rate, we understood the need for a sustainable solution that addressed both hunger and unemployment. Moreover, as we delved deeper into the philanthropic landscape, we realized that other noteworthy causes were grappling with similar funding challenges. \n\n In response, we developed a unique vehicle at Food on Every Table, offering a means for anyone with a worthy cause to generate income, creating a versatile platform that empowers diverse initiatives. Out of this realization, Food on Every Table emerged â€“ a dynamic solution uniting non-profits and individuals, fostering a community where support and financial sustainability converge to create meaningful change. Our journey reflects the resilience born from adversity, as we strive to make a lasting impact on the lives of those facing hunger, unemployment, and a shortage of funding for their noble causes."
